# Project Charter

## Project Title

State Polytechnic of Malang Inventory Management App

## Project Purpose

The purpose of the app is to streamline the process of managing the inventory of State Polytechnic of Malang. There are many items in the inventory, and it's hard to keep track of them. The app will help the admins to manage the inventory more easily. The app will also help the students to borrow items from the inventory.

## Project Objectives

- To create a user-friendly mobile and web-based application that allows students, staff, and faculty to borrow and return items from the university inventory.
- To improve inventory management by providing tracking and reporting of item usage, availability, and maintenance needs.
- To increase transparency and accountability in the borrowing and returning process.
- To reduce manual paperwork and administrative workload associated with inventory management.
- To enhance security by implementing user authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- The project is a web app that can be accessed by the admins of the inventory using a web browser.
- The app should have a basic authentication feature to ensure that only the authorized users can access the app.
- The app should be able to provide a way for the admins to manage the inventory, such as adding, removing, and updating the inventory.
- The admin should be able to search for items in the inventory easily.
- The app should be able to provide a way for the admins to manage the users, such as adding, removing, and updating the users.
- Students should be able to access the app to see the inventory, but they should not be able to modify the inventory.
- The app should provide a way for students to borrow items from the inventory and return them. Each item can only be borrowed for a certain amount of time.
- The admins should be able to see the history of the inventory, such as the history of the items being borrowed and returned.
- The app should never give an invalid state of the inventory, such as negative quantity of items, etc.
- The app should be able to provide a way for the admins to manage the categories of the items in the inventory.

### Out of Scope

- Integration with other systems, such as the university's student information system for Single Sign-On (SSO).
- Physical security of the inventory, such as the security of the storage room, etc.
